# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Recognize cucumbers which have flaws or some other problem with computer vision neural networks model.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Manual work is hard and looking cucumbers whole day is depressing.
* This time could be used to do some other stuff eg laying seeds in farms
* Also, if you want to save some money, you do not need anymore a specialized cucumber inspector


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:

## Summary
Computer vision model which recognizes faulty cucumbers.

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
- Hiring is expensive and we do not want to use manual work for inspecting cucumbers
- We have to pay less salary
- Computer is accurate
- We use this everyday every night


## How is it used?
So you are farmer and you do not want to hire someone to look cucumbers whole day. Therefore, you code a program to do that task for you.



## Data sources and AI methods
We need images of cucumbers from farmers. First, we have to train a basic convolutional neural network model with labeled cucumber images (faulty and desirable). After that we can start using our model to recognize faulty cucumbers in our factory.

## Challenges
The main challenge is getting these images of cucumbers. Then, we have to make sure that we have enough images of faulty cucumbers to prevent overfitting problem with neural networks which is very flexible model.

## What next?
We will build a SAAS startup and make IPO 50 billion dollar in NYSE 2022.
