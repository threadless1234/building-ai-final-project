# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
Computer vision model which recognizes faulty cucumbers.

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
- Hiring is expensive and we do not want to use manual work for inspecting cucumbers
- We have to pay less salary
- Computer is accurate
- We use this everyday every night


## How is it used?
So you are farmer and you do not want to hire someone to look cucumbers whole day. Therefore, you code a program to do that task for you.



## Data sources and AI methods
We need images of cucumbers from farmers. First, we have to train a basic convolutional neural network model with labeled cucumber images (faulty and desirable). After that we can start using our model to recognize faulty cucumbers in our factory.

## Challenges
The main challenge is getting these images of cucumbers. Then, we have to make sure that we have enough images of faulty cucumbers to prevent overfitting problem with neural networks which is very flexible model.

## What next?
We will build a SAAS startup and make IPO 50 billion dollar in NYSE 2022.
